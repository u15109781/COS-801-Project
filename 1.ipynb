      "Text Data: Second, until late in the 20th century, the Ottoman state did not aim to assimilate or Turkify its population. Nations are not as novel as some historians and social scientists assume, and it is beyond doubt that the Ottoman elites who were of Turkish origin had an idea about what being a Turk meant. Yet, the understanding of nationalism differs quite starkly from age to age. The 20th-century tendency of solidifying a country's internal cohesion by assimilating minorities did not seem to have crossed the minds of Ottomans for the majority of their history. The Greek conversion to Islam and 'Turkishness', of which we still know too little, during and after the Conquest of Anatolia by the Seljuk Turks seems to have been an automatic process rather than a conscious effort by Turks to convert Greeks. The same applies to Albanian Muslims, Bosnians, and Pomaks in the Balkans. And even these do not speak Turkish, despite identifying as 'Turkish' in the 20th century and their culture displaying a marked influence of Turkish. Even the term 'Turkish' as used by them amounted to nothing more than 'Muslim'. Hence, no 'converted' population or 'Turkish enclaves' in the old Ottoman Empire. The extent of 'Ottoman colonialism' is still a subject of debate among historians, but I think everyone would agree that Turkification is a much more limited and later phenomenon when compared to Europeanisation that came with European colonialism.\n",
      "I'm not sure if that is the same thing. Turkomans in Syria and Iraq is more because of the border-gore that happened after WW1. It doesn't really address the issue why there are no significant enclaves in Egypt or Jordan.\n",
